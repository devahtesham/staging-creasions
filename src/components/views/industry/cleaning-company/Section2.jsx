                                    As household incomes rise, the demand for cleaning services in major
                                    cities continues to grow. Whether big or small, cleaning companies
                                    have incredible potential for profitability and long-term success.
                                    However, the challenge for any service-based business lies in
                                    consistently attracting and retaining clients. Today&apos;s consumers
                                    turn to the internet to find and compare services, including
                                    cleaning companies. If you want to reach more potential clients, you
                                    need a strong online presenceâ€”one that ensures your services are
                                    easily found where your audience is searching.
