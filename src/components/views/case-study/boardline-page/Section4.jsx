                                We began by reimagining the Boardline brand, aligning it with a more
                                modern and innovative approach to HOA learning. Our UI/UX design
                                process focused on simplifying the learning experience, making the
                                platform intuitive and easy to navigate for users of all experience
                                levels. We also designed the platform to offer robust features,
                                including course tracking, assessments, and user support. The
                                website was developed to introduce Boardline Academy to the market,
                                clearly outlining its unique value, while the app was optimized for
                                mobile access to ensure flexibility for users.
